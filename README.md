# OOP-Ex4 - BOY 

This project represents a game where a group of Agents have to catch as many Pokemons (of varying value) on a directed weighted 
graph and in order to achieve the best result the Agents will try to catch
As many Pokemons as possible with maximum value.
Data structures and algorithms of this assignment are based on a previous project [OOP-Ex3](https://github.com/B-O-Y-group/OOP-Ex3.git). 



**Our Algorithm**

The idea of the algorithm is to find for each agent the closest Pokemon, and so we will be caught
as many Pokemons as possible.

You can find the full information about the function here [wiki](https://github.com/B-O-Y-group/OOP-Ex4/wiki).



**How to play:**

To start the game the player need to go to where  the project file saved 
and write in path file "cmd" . 

For choosing the level 
the player need to write "java -jar Ex4_Server_v0.0.jar 0-15 " 
when the last is the number of the level (from 0 to 15).

Here is an instructional video on how to open and play the game [video](
